First we should know about Generics before learning template.
Generics:
        It is a idea of allowing datatypes such as integer,string to be a parameter to methods,classes and interfaces.
        means we can leave the datatypes empty to initialize later which is the concept of generics.
Templates:
        A template is tool in c++ that allows functions and classes to operate with generic types.
          means it is an advantages of c++ in which we can define the datatypes later determining it from the input data in the functions and classes with the use of template.

Syntax:
  template<typename identifier> return_type fun_name(parameters){
body;
}
